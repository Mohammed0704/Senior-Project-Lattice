    This next operation is important, this is how you find element(s) in the HTML.
        When on a website, you can right click and inspect element, and there you can see where that element is in the HTML
        Now, you can search for things by their different attributes (if they have them) like:
            By.CLASS_NAME
            By.ID
            By.CSS_SELECTOR
            By.XPATH
        In this case, there were no class names or IDs to go by, so I used XPATH
        The way to get an HTML element's XPATH is to inspect the HTML on the page, right click the element you want, hover on the "Copy" option, then 
            either choose "Copy XPath" for a relative XPATH (like the one right below), or "Copy full XPath" for an absolute XPATH from the initial HTML tag.

    '''
    For this next operation, if you look at the HTML on the page, there is a tbody element and a bunch of tr (table rows) elements inside it.
    So, once we have the tbody element stored in the varibale housingCostsTable, we can use that as an anchor to gather all the tr's that it contains 
    using the next operation which literally reads:
        Find all the tr elements inside of the tbody element and store them in a list
